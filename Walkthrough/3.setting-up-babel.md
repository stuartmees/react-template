## Webpack with Babel

Babel transpiles code into vanilla JS that any browser can read. Install it as follows:

```
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

To use Babel with Webpack the Webpack Loader needs to be installed:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-loader
```

Add the following file to your route `.babelrc`, and add the bbel config:

>/.babelrc
```
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

The add instruction in the `webpack.config.js` that tells webpack which files to use babel for:

```
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ['babel-loader']
      }
    ]
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['*', '.js']
  }
  ```
